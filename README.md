# Control-Panel

**Task 1 Engines sliders**

I have made 6 sliders for each engine with the range is shown and two buttons one for saving the values for each engine in the database and the other one is for the run. 
I used HTML , CSS, some Javascript and PHP with MySQL.


**Task 2 Movement**

The movements page have 5 buttons stop, left, right, forward and backward each click on one of them will take you to the PHP page and save the value in the database.
I linked the first task with this task by a next and previous button to make it easier.

**Task 3 Chatbot**


I insert the chatbot in task 2 page and I trained him to answer some questions about the trains in Saudi Arabia like the time, cost, and including SAR (Saudi Arabia Railways).
